#### A passionate mexican developer specializing in frontend, backend, and mobile app development.

With solid experience in **`Vue`**, **`Vuetify`**, **`Quasar`**, and **`Flutter`**, I design intuitive interfaces and develop elegant and high-performance mobile applications. In the backend, I rely on **`Express.js`** and leverage cloud technologies like **`AWS`** to build scalable and robust solutions. I also have experience in developing applications for the **`Internet of Things (IoT)`**.<br><br>
I firmly believe that _programming is a world full of limitless possibilities_, where every line of code has the power to turn ideas into reality. And, of course, as a true programmer, I enjoy a moment of relaxation with a cold beer while challenging my skills and solving problems.  
I'm always ready to embark on exciting projects and collaborate with passionate individuals in the technology field. Let's come together and create quality code while exploring new frontiers! Skol! üçª<br>
